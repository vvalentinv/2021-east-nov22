// Objects, everything but the primitives are objects

// When we know the name of the key, we can use dot notation (litteral)

// When we don't know, or want to use a variable, we use the square bracket notation

// We read by accessing the value the same way as a variable
bob;
someObject.someKey;

// We set a value by assigning it

bob = 5;
someObject.someKey = 10;

// Methods, functions defined inside an object

// this ? this represent the context of where the function is defined.
